# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains a collection of solutions to LeetCode problems that Iâ€™ve personally solved as part of my interview preparation and learning journey. While initially focused on Ruby, solutions in other programming languages will be added over time. The goal of this repository is to serve as a helpful reference for anyone preparing for coding interviews, practicing algorithms, or strengthening problem-solving skills.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shafiqam/leetcode.git
```

### 2. Browse Solutions
- Solutions are organized by topic, language and problem title.
- Files may be grouped by language in subfolders (e.g., /ruby, /python, /javascript, etc.).
- Each solution includes comments and (where applicable) analysis of time and space complexity.

## Notes
1. Each file includes the problem description (for quick reference), a link to the LeetCode problem, and multiple approaches if attempted.
2. Comments and code clarity are prioritized to make each solution easy to understand.
3. Time and space complexity analysis is provided when possible.

I created this repository to track my own progress and growth while preparing for technical interviews and wanted to share it in the hope that it helps others too.

_Happy coding and best of luck with your prep!_
