# LeetCode Solutions

This repository provides a collection of solutions to LeetCode problems (currently implemented in Ruby). It aims to help you hone your coding skills, tackle algorithmic challenges, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/shafiqam/leetcode.git
```

### 2. Set Up Language 
  Ruby:
  - Ensure you have a compatible Ruby version installed. You can check by running ruby -v in your terminal.
  - If needed, download and install Ruby from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/.
  - Consider using a version manager like rbenv or rvm for managing multiple Ruby versions.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute your own LeetCode solutions! Here's a suggested approach:
1. Fork the Repository: Go to https://github.com/ and fork this repository to your account. 
2. Create a New Branch: Navigate to your local copy and create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
3. Add Your Solution:
    - Create a new file for your solution (e.g., 001_two_sum.rb).
    - Include a clear description, time/space complexity analysis, and well-commented code following Ruby coding conventions.
4. Commit and Push Changes: `git add .`
5. `git commit -m "Added solution for problem #001 - Two Sum"`
6. `git push origin your-branch-name`
7. Create a Pull Request:
    - On GitHub, go to your forked repository and create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch of this repository.

## Additional Notes

* Consider using consistent naming conventions for your solution files (e.g., problem_number followed by _solution.rb).
* Include time and space complexity analysis for your solutions where applicable.
* Provide clear comments to explain your code's logic.
* If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to create an issue or pull request on this repository.

By following these guidelines, we can create a valuable resource for the community and aspiring LeetCode problem solvers!
